# Algorithmic Paradigms

## Divide and Conquer
Idea: Divide a problem into two or more sub-problems, solve these recursively, and then put solutions together to a solution of the given problem.

Examples: Mergesort, Quicksort, Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication, FFT.

## Dynamic Programming
Idea: Break up a problem into a series of overlapping
 sub-problems, and build up solutions to larger and larger sub-problems. 
prune and search for  solving optimization problems
another idea：Brute force through all possible solutions, storing solutions to
subproblems to avoid repeat computation

Example: Floyd-Warshall algorithm for the all pairs shortest path problem

## Backtracking
– A clever form of exhaustive search

## Greedy Algorithms

Idea: Find solution by always making the choice that looks optimal at the moment — don’t look ahead, never go back.
Examples: Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm for a minimum spanning tree. Shortest path
